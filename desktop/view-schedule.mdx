Durate offers two efficient ways for you to view and manage your schedule, ensuring that you stay organized and prepared for your shifts. This guide walks you through both options: using the built-in calendar and syncing your schedule with your preferred external calendar.

### Option 1: Using the Built-in Calendar

The built-in calendar is the quickest way to access your schedule directly within the platform. Here’s how it works:

1. **Locate the Calendar**: At the top of the page, you’ll see the calendar interface.
2. **View Your Shifts**: Your assigned shifts will automatically appear on the calendar. Each shift is displayed with relevant details such as the time, location, and type of shift.
3. **Customize Your View**: Use the navigation controls to switch between daily, weekly, or monthly views to get the perspective that best suits your needs.

This option is ideal for quick access and on-the-go schedule management.


### Option 2: Syncing with External Calendars

For seamless integration into your daily workflow, you can sync your schedule with your personal calendar application. Durate supports syncing with the following calendar applications:

- **Google Calendar**
- **Outlook Calendar**
- **Apple Calendar**

#### How to Sync Your Calendar

1. **Find the Sync Button**: Navigate to the upper right-hand corner of the schedule page.
2. **Click "Sync Calendar"**: A prompt will appear with instructions for connecting to your preferred calendar application.
3. **Follow the Instructions**: Complete the setup by following the step-by-step instructions provided. This process typically involves signing in to your external calendar account and granting permission to sync.
4. **View Your Schedule**: Once synced, your shifts will appear directly in your personal calendar, complete with updates for any schedule changes.

<Tip>
Fun fact: Durate ensures your calendar stays up-to-date automatically. Any shift changes will appear instantly, so there's no need to sync more than once.
