Durate makes it easy to manage your shift swaps, whether you're looking to give away your shifts or take on new ones. This guide explains how to sell or trade your shifts and how to accept swaps from the **Coverage Pool**.

<Note>
Reminder: Shift swaps need to be approved by an administrator before finalization.

## Definitions 

- **Selling** means making your shifts available for anyone in the department to pick up.  

- **Trading** involves a direct request to exchange a shift with a specific person.

You can choose to **sell shifts**, **trade shifts**, or **do both** at the same time. 

## Selling/Trading Shifts

All selling and trading of shifts is done on the **main dashboard**, located at the **bottom right-hand corner of the page**. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Select the Shift**: Navigate to the shift you’d like to give away on your dashboard.  
2. **Choose Your Action**: Click whether you’d like to:
   - Sell the shift
   - Trade it with another physician
   - Do both  
3. **Add a Comment (Optional)**: Provide additional details or notes about your request, such as a preference for who takes the shift.  
4. **Submit the Request**: Click **Submit**, and the shift will be sent to the **Coverage Pool**, where it becomes visible to other physicians.

<Tip>
Tip: Combining selling and trading allows you to maximize the chances of finding a replacement for your shift while still having the option to exchange it for one that works better for you.

## Receiving Shift Swaps

Once a shift is added to the Coverage Pool, you can accept swaps in two ways: through direct trade requests or by browsing available shifts in the pool. You can explore the shifts listed in the **Coverage Pool** section and accept any that fit your schedule by clicking **Accept**.

<Tip>
Tip: To stay on top of incoming trade requests, check the **Notifications** section, where you can easily manage any pending swaps.

By using these features, you can efficiently manage shift swaps, ensuring your schedule remains flexible and stress-free.
